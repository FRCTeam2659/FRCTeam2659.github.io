        <h2>Team Structure</h2>
        <p>The team is organized into three technical sub-teams and three management sub-teams,
        each with at least one students leader and one mentor. The technical sub-teams are in charge of designing,
        powering, and programming the robot whereas the business sub-teams are in charge of all team logistics.
        The tasks assigned to the management sub-teams include: logistics and outreach, finding and communicating
        with sponsors, scheduling, preparing all award submissions and presentations, completing the bill of materials,
        and handling all purchases and finances. The professional volunteers fulfill the roles of Team Lead Mentor,
        Lead Technical Mentor, and Lead Management Mentor. These roles oversee team administration and travel,
        the development of the robot, finances, and purchases. Prior to the build season, stidents fill out forms
        nominating themselves for leadership positions. These students are interviewed by the mentors and the mentors
        choose the students who they believe would best fill these leadership positions.</p>

                            <h2>Past Structure</h2>
                        <p>The team organization is one that relies on various support structures that will help the students to obtain the most out of the provided curriculum.
                            Both items go hand in hand for assisting the progression of the students individual skills.
                            Image below shows the past organizational chart for the team and how the structure is compromised.</p>
                            <img src="img/flowchart.png" width="100%">
                        <p>The organizational chart above shows the past scenario that has been observed on the RoboWarriors.
                            Kevin, Brian, and other additional mentor support are solely responsible for all students that attend
                            the events and also during build season. The structure is feasible but will likely not result in full student individual
                            success over the course of the program. This is due to the required attention to all aspects of the program required by the mentors above.</p>
