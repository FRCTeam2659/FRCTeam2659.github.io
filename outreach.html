            <h4>Children's Hospital Los Angeles</h4>
            <p class="text">Children’s Hospital Los Angeles relies on the generosity of philanthropists in the community to support compassionate patient care, leading-edge education of the caregivers of tomorrow and innovative research efforts that impact the children at the hospital. Starting in the summer of 2017 the RoboWarriors will work tirelessly to impact the lives of the patients at CHLA. A donation will be given to CHLA at the end of the calendar year and team members will volunteer at the hospital and give STEM demonstrations to the patients.</p>
            <h4>Granada Hills Holiday Parade</h4>
            <p class="text">The Granada Hills Holiday Parade Route is 1.8 miles long and is the largest participant and spectator community parade in the San Fernando Valley. Annual parade participation is over 3000 youth participants including marching bands, drill teams civic groups, equestrian groups, and now a robotics team. By participating in the parade, the team is given a platform to spread the mission of Bishop Alemany High School, the RoboWarriors and FIRST Robotics.</p>
            <h4>Best Friends Animal Society</h4>
            <p class="text">Everyday nearly 5500 cats and dogs are killed in shelters because they do not have a place to call home.  The mission at Best Animal Society is to save them all. Best Friends is one of the largest no-kill shelters in the country and they have a location less than a quarter of a mile away from Bishop Alemany High School. RoboWarrior team members will volunteer at this location to walk, play and be companions with the animals at this location. The RoboWarriors have even outfitted their t-shirt cannon to act as a  tennis ball launcher. This allows team members to play fetch with the dogs at the shelter and promote STEM simultaneously.</p>
            <h4>MEND</h4>
            <p class="text">Meet Each Need with Dignity, MEND, opened its doors in an effort to transform the lives of the neediest residents of the San Fernando Valley. MEND’s mission is to break the bonds of poverty by providing basic human needs and a pathway to self-reliance. As a team the RoboWarrior’s will spend one Friday afternoon every month volunteering at MEND in order to help the organization achieve its mission. In addition, the RoboWarriors will conduct food and clothing drives during the holiday season at Bishop Alemany High School</p>
            <h4>Exceptional Halloween Dance</h4>
            <p class="text">For nearly three decades Bishop Alemany has hosted a very special, annual event called the Exceptional Halloween Dance. The event invites family and friends of special needs children to the campus of Bishop Alemany for a night of games, dancing and fun. Not only will the team bring its most recent robot to the dance and spread the mission of FIRST, but team members also volunteer at the dance and help plan the event.</p>
            <h4>Demonstrations</h4>
            <p class="text">The RoboWarriors display their robot at different events including elementary school assemblies, science fairs, and at their sponsor’s locations. Robot demonstrations allows the RoboWarriors to inspire students to pursue a STEM education, spread the mission of FIRST and give the sponsors a first-hand look of the benefit of the team’s partnership.</p>
            <h4>De La Salle Festival</h4>
            <p class="text">One of the largest feeder schools of Bishop Alemany is De La Salle and they host an annual festival for their families. The festival is attended by nearly every family in the school and most of the students will attend Bishop Alemany when they graduate from De La Salle. The RoboWarriors will use the festival to display their robot and generate interest in STEM education. In addition the RoboWarriors sponsor a booth to fundraise for their feeder school.</p>
            <h4>Mentoring other teams</h4>
            <p class="text">The goals for the next year include helping the RoboWarrior’s community. Coming from a school who is committed to Serve, the robotics team is prepared to help other schools around MIssion Hills to start up new robotics teams. This will carry out the team’s mission statement by inspiring young students to pursue FIRST and STEM. The students at Bishop Alemany/Santa Rosa will be assisted by the RoboWarriors in starting a FIRST Lego League.</p>
