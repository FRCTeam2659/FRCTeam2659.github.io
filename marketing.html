        <h2>What is Marketing?</h2>
        <h4>But I'm not selling anything am I?</h4>
        <p class="text"><i>FIRST</i> is all about selling the Science & Engineering professions to students to convince them to pursue these careers.
        You also promote your team to potential student members, to judges, to potential alliance partners.
        You are selling <i>FIRST</i> to your sponsors in convincing them to invest in you and your future.
        You are selling both <i>FIRST</i> and your team everyday.</p>

        <h4>Who's the customer?</h4>
        <ul class="text">
            <li> Sponsors both existing and potential
            <li> Your school administration for their political support
            <li> Teachers who might become team advisors or trip chaparones
            <li> Parent prospects for booster support
            <li> Potential student members
            <li> Potential mentors
            <li> FIRST awards judges
            <li> FIRST alliance teams
        </ul>

        <p class="text">We need to sell students on <i>FIRST</i> and how they can make a difference in the world through an engineering career.
        According to a National Academy of Engineering report the four best messages that get a student's attention are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Engineers make a world of difference
            <li>Engineers are creative problem-solvers
            <li>Engineers help shape the future
            <li>Engineering is essential to our health, happiness, and safety
        </ul>
        <p class="text">Many students don't enjoy math and science enough to become engineers for those reasons,
        so stressing that engineers get to do a lot of science & math attracts a very small percentage of students to the field.</p>

        <h2>Elements of Marketing</h2>
        <p class="text">Develop a marketing plan to give your team definition, planning, organization, message clarity, content, service, administration, personality, usefulness.</p>

        <h5>Potential Team Members (Students and Mentors) </h5>
        <p>The team strives to recruit team members, both students and mentors, because the team members are the most important component of the team.

The RoboWarriors also encourage teachers and parents to mentor and help as well. The best way the team can reach potential team members is through the various outreach and mentoring programs. There, the team can encourage interest in STEM, FIRST and the RoboWarriors. </p>
