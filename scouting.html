        <h2>Scouting</h2>
        <p>One of the most important competition aspects of FRC, scouting other teams, is too frequently overlooked. Especially, when teams are new or have few members and limited resources, but even a mediocre robot can win with great strategy built on great scouting. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Knowing your opponents strengths/weaknesses wins matches </li>
            <li>Knowing your alliance partners strengths/weaknesses wins matches </li>
            <li>Knowing your own strengths/weaknesses wins matches </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Picking partners and setting match strategy based on randomly watching matches leaves you with bad impressions of robots that made phenominal efforts when you were out getting lunch and were crippled by a field error when you happened to see one of their matches. Scouting is much more than casually watching each match to see one robot that is better than the others. While the crowds are oooing over one flamboyant play, your scouts need to be watching the other robots to find the solid performers in the bunch. One flamboyant play will stick in the minds of casual observers and make them want to pick that robot, but forget that robot's mediocre performance the rest of the day. The audience will remember a robot broke down and forever think of it as undependable even if it turns out to have been a field error. Good scouting lets you pick out that under appreciated robot that scores or defends consistantly and brings home a steady dependable match every time even when the rest of their alliance under performs and they lose the match and end up way down in the rankings. At the end of qualifiers 8 teams will be picking 16 other teams and if you only remember that the guys in the top 8 had good robots, how are you going to pick the other two robots that will account for two thirds of your strategy and scoring? </p>
        <h3>Type of scouting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet scouting (<i>FIRST</i> team database, team websites, Chiefdelphi, Blue Alliance)
            <ul class="white">
                <li>Robot photos
                <li>Match video (The Blue Alliance)
                <li>Basic data
                <li>Preliminary capabilities
                <li>Team history of performance and reliability
            </ul>
            <li>Pit scouting (roving packs of scouters)
            <ul class="white">
                <li>Talk to pit crews (drive teams too if you can)
                <li>Take current robot photos
                <li>Collect data on type of drive train, power (# of motors), wheel traction material, manipulators, complex or simple design, etc.
                <li>Visually observe robots and pits. Does a robot seem to be under repair a lot? Do they have ready to go spare parts & assemblies?
                <li>Collect robot information sheets describing robot capabilities, past performance, special characteristics
                <li>Talk to other scouters (robot capabilities/record)
            </ul>
            <li>Match scouting (sedentary group of scouters)
            <ul class="white">
                <li>Collect results, both subjective (defense success, speed, stability, drive team skill) and objective (points scored, mechanical reliability, penalities)
                <li>What did they do in autonomous/hybrid. Will you interfere with one another as partners? Can they disrupt you or you them as opponents?
                <li>Drive team impressions easy/hard to work with, cooperative/uncooperative
                <li>What strategies defeat them?
                <li>What strategies do they defeat?
            </ul>
            <li>Remote event scouting (after the fact for robots you'll compete with at upcoming events)
            <ul class="white">
                <li>Standings
                <li>Match Records
                <li>Detailed analysis
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Scouting Process</h3>
        <ul class="white">
            <li>Decide what you want to know about each robot.
            <li>Make simple pit & match scouting sheets.
            <li>Watch, even visit, early regionals if possible to see what other data you missed
            <li>Ask the coach/drive team/match strategist what they want to know each match.
            <li>Train your scouters on Practice Day or match video from early regionals.
            <li>Assign a scouter to every robot on the field for each match of the day (one or more people).
            <li>Collect photos of every robot to prompt your memory later.
            <li>As data comes available brief your drive team on partners & opponents for each match.
            <li>Debrief drive team for impressions/details after each match.
            <li>Review your data after the first day of Qualifiers.
                <ul>
                    <li>Discuss pros & cons as a group with the photos to remind everyone.
                    <li>Develop preliminary best lists that complement your robot & anticipated strategy. May be best offensive robots and best defensive robots.
                </ul>
            <li>Watch the robots on your best lists during the last qualifying matches.
            <li>Refine and finalize your lists. Don't forget to watch for late bloomers robots that finally get it together after a rough beginning.
            <li>Send your Team Captain to Alliance picks with your final lists, even if you aren't doing the picking. Compare lists for that all important third pick overlooked diamond.
            <li>Joint Alliance briefing/strategizing on finals matches.
        </ul>
        <h3>Some Issues to Consider</h3>
        <ul class="white">
            <li>Scout yourself as well as others to know where your real strengths and weaknesses lie
            <li>How will you evaluate robot performance & reliability, drive team teamwork, and strategy
            <li>Head Scouter must be well organized
            <li>Scouts must be trained so every report is consistent in how performance is rated.
            <li>Keep it simple
            <li>Your scouting should match your people resources.
            <li>Counts and multiple choice answers are easiest to sort and analyze team performance. Essay and freeform write in answers are only good as backup material.
            <li>Paper records vs computerized
                <ul>
                    <li>Paper never fails. It's easy to pull a team summary from and pass around, but is hard to sort and analyze all teams by different criteria
                    <li>Computer requires resources and data entry can be time consuming. Data can be forever lost. Convenient power outlets can be hard to come by. Very useful for displaying current robot photos.
                </ul>
            <li>Save team performance, reliability, cooperation data year-to-year to build up a history for future seasons
        </ul>
        <h2>The RoboWarriors Scouting System</h2>
        <h4>Basics:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Set of properties we keep track of are each assigned a decision weight reflecting their importance to us
            <li>Individual scouting reports for each robot in each match are entered and maintained
            <li>Analysis allows us to sort teams based on any property, such as, maneuverability, points scored, defense played, penalities
        </ul>
