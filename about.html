            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>FRC Team 2659 RoboWarriors</h3>
            <p>Bishop Alemany High School is a catholic secondary school located in Mission Hills, CA. The high school has an enrollment of
                approximately 1350 students throughout the San Fernando Valley. These students have the capability of joining various clubs to build
                upon their skills for future enrollment in post-secondary education and beyond. One of the extracurriculars is participation with the Alemany robotics team,
                the RoboWarriors. The RoboWarriors compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) each year to develop their science, technology, engineering, and math skills while also building
                upon their character / interpersonal skills to become our future’s leaders. This document is to outline the strategy for the 2018 season and beyond as the 2017 season comes to a close.</p>

            <h2>Team Background</h2>
            <p>The RoboWarriors began back in 2008 on a mission as a rookie team to begin their venture into the realm of competitive high school robotics.
                Their initial start was a great one that lead the team to the elimination finals that year coming short of a gold medal finish.
                Fast forward to next year where the team went on to compete and obtained their share of gold with a win at the Los Angeles regional.
                Since 2009, the team has had their fair share of ups and downs with shifting roles and responsibilities. Kevin O’Shea, a science instructor with Bishop Alemany,
                has been leading the team for the past handful of years with the assistance of Brian Gobeli, representing Universal Studios Hollywood’s Technical Services.
                Returning student, Joe Bachmann, has also been assisting in the team's efforts over the years. The team has just completed it’s 2017 season ready to enhance
                their future strategic plan to provide the students students with the best technical and interpersonal skills after completing the program.</p>
