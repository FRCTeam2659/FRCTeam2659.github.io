        <h2>How to Make a Website</h2>
        <h3>Essentials</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Planning
                <ul class="white">
                    <li>Purpose-what do you want to accomplish? How will your site be used?
                    <li>A website should have something of value to offer visitors: current information, a team-centric gathering place, personal interest blog, multimedia, articles, stories.
                    <li>Lay out a flowchart of your site map. How many pages and for what purpose, on what topics? What links to what? Sketch it all out.
                    <li>Plan on changing your mind and on future growth.
                    <li>How much time do you plan to devote to maintaining, upgrading, adding content? Forums, blogs, and wiki's require a LOT of effort to maintain.
                    <li>Plan your content including future growth. Make your content quickly scan-able by the casual browser.
                    <li>Organization-make it easy to maintain by separating things out through your directory structure.
                    <li>Include a contact email link.
                </ul>
            <li>Design
                <ul class="white">
                    <li>Try to engage, inform, entertain your visitors
                    <li>Common theme throughout
                    <li>Easy-on-the-eyes color schemes
                    <li>Keep the number of distinct colors down
                    <li>Stress subtle effects rather than distracting ones. Avoid too active pages. Use to be everyone put motion gifs everywhere. Motion attracts the eye and if the whole is in motion people won't know where to look.
                    <li>Mockup your design and get several other web-savvy people to critic it.
                </ul>
            <li class="white">Optimize for speed-small compressed graphics, common shared graphics that don't have to be re-downloaded, slim your HTML down.
            <li class="white">Clarity- be direct and to the point in your writing. Be consistent in where buttons are placed, how links are displayed. Don't overcrowd the page, preserve lots of whitespace so the users eye goes automatically to what's important. Visitors will read short words and simple sentences, but skip over large blocks of words. Keep your paragraphs short, maybe a couple of sentences.
            <li class="white">Keep content current. Update your pages regularly. Whether they are your teammates, community, or other <i>FIRST</i> teams, make people want to come back often to see what's new. Check and fix or remove broken links, especially, to outside sites that can change with no notice. Periodically take a figurative step back and take a critical look at your own work. Does it still fit your plan or have you aimlessly wandered and muddied the waters?

        <p class="text">It is always a good idea to validate your website’s HTML and CSS to the World Wide Web Consortium standards.  Validating your website ensures that your website complies with the current standards on the web, put forth by the W3C.  Why comply with the W3C standards?  Web browsers and devices that are used to browse the web are designed around these standards.  Validating your code improves the compatibility of your website across a variety of browsers and devices.</p>
