        <h2>About This Site</h2>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>Students designed</h3>
            <p class="text">This website is not a third-party theme or template. This website was drafted and designed on paper and graphics editors by the student Devon Gaur. It was then accomplished by building and tweaking the design ideas using text editors to write out the HTML, CSS, JS and PHP running the website by student Peter Wang. The current design is the first version of the website, and it's a milestone that we are more approaching professionalism.</p>
            <h3>Original and Organized Code</h3>
            <p class="text">We designed the many features of the website on paper first, and then began to transfer them to image mock ups. After coming up with various ideas, they were realized and reviewed. Students developed the HTML, CSS, JS and PHP by hand to ensure the documents are correct, simple, and understandable.</p>
